  Todo:
 1. export pciedev_llseek from upciedev driver
 2. lines below potentially can crash appliation (file:pciedev_ufn.c,line:~206)
    cdev_del(&pciedev_cdev_m->pciedev_dev_m[k]->cdev);
    if(pciedev_cdev_m->pciedev_dev_m[k]){
        kfree(pciedev_cdev_m->pciedev_dev_m[k]);
        pciedev_cdev_m->pciedev_dev_m[k] = 0;
    }
 3. Calling 'register_upciedev_proc' function instide the function 'pciedev_probe_exp' is not correct. 
    The function 'register_upciedev_proc' modifies 3rd arguments 'pciedev_procdir' field for each device.  
    But this field is unique for entire driver. See better implementation in the file  'pciedev_ufn2.c' line:~30. 
 4. Slot number finding does not works correctly.  
    file:pciedev_probe_exp.c,line:~129-150 (func:pciedev_probe_exp). 
	My tries is file:pciedev_ufn2.c,line:590,file:GetSlotNumber. 
	tmp_parent_num is taken manually for each driver (for example for `esdadio` it is 1). 
	I think we can calculate this without this manual variable assignment.
