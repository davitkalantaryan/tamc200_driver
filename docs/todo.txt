  Todo:
 1. export pciedev_llseek from upciedev driver
 2. lines below potentially can crash appliation (file:pciedev_ufn.c,line:~206)
    cdev_del(&pciedev_cdev_m->pciedev_dev_m[k]->cdev);
    if(pciedev_cdev_m->pciedev_dev_m[k]){
        kfree(pciedev_cdev_m->pciedev_dev_m[k]);
        pciedev_cdev_m->pciedev_dev_m[k] = 0;
    }
 3. Calling 'register_upciedev_proc' function instide the function 'pciedev_probe_exp' is not correct. 
    The function 'register_upciedev_proc' modifies 3rd arguments 'pciedev_procdir' field for each device.  
    But this field is unique for entire driver. See better implementation in the file  'pciedev_ufn2.c' line:~30.
